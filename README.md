Front and backend code for a custom web app that tracks spending and budgets.
## Description
This app will be an attempt to digitize and streamline a very convoluted process I have for tracking my spending, budgets, and account balances. This process currently involves two spreadsheets, a top-bound notebook, and manually entering information from accounts and statements. Whether it will prove useful to anyone other than me, it is an opportunity for me to hone my fullstack development skills.
